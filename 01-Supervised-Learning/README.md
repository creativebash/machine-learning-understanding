## Introduction

Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where models are trained on labeled data to make predictions. It is widely used for tasks like regression (predicting continuous values) and classification (predicting categorical labels). This directory provides tutorials, code, and datasets to help you understand and implement supervised learning algorithms.

## Algorithms Covered

1. **Linear Regression**: Predict continuous values using a linear model.
2. **Logistic Regression**: Classify binary outcomes using a logistic function.
3. **Decision Trees**: Learn hierarchical decision rules for classification and regression.
4. **Random Forests**: Improve accuracy by combining multiple decision trees.
5. **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**: Find optimal hyperplanes for classification.
6. **k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)**: Classify based on similarity to neighboring data points.
7. **Naive Bayes**: Use probabilistic models for classification.
8. **Gradient Boosting**: Combine weak learners to create a strong predictive model.
